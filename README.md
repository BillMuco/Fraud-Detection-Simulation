# Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions

## Introduction
This document provides an overview of the **Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions** project, outlining the context, objectives, key insights, and visualizations used. The dataset in this simulation represents real-world financial transactions, helping to identify fraudulent activities and improve security measures.

## Context & Purpose
The dataset simulates financial transactions, including transaction amounts, customer IDs, and transaction types. The goal of this analysis is to:

- Detect fraudulent transactions based on spending patterns and anomalies.
- Assess high-risk transaction types and their impact on fraud occurrences.
- Provide insights into fraud prevention strategies.

## Visualizations in the Dashboard
To effectively present insights, the following visualizations were created:

### 1. Fraud vs. Non-Fraud Transaction Count (Bar Chart)
